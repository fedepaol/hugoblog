Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, I work remotely (from Pisa, Italy) as a member of the Telco 5G networking team. As part of my job I contributed new features to a variety of projects in the kubernetes ecosystem, such as the container networking plugins, the SR-IOV operator, OPA gatekeeper, OVN-Kubernetes, more recently MetalLB (and many others).

Before that, I was working for List implementing mission critical distributed systems in the field of finance first as a developer, then in a leader role.

I am currently maintaining the [MetalLB project](https://metallb.universe.tf/)

When I don't write code or chase my kids I am probably running or baking pizza.
