Lead developer with electronic trading software by day, passionate about opensource. Used to write a lot of code in my spare time. Now I am a dad and you know where most of my spare time goes to. But I keep trying!

### Interests

I Also wrote some Kotlin.
In the past year (2018) I moved to Go and distributed systems.
