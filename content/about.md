Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, passionate about opensource. Used to write a lot of code in my spare time. Now I am a dad and you know where most of my spare time goes to, but luckily I found a job that satisfies my needs :-)

### Interests

I've done **a lot** of Android in my spare time. It was kind of a second job. I started when *AsyncTasks* where the way to interact with a background thread and Eclipse was the official IDE, up to when architectural patterns like MVP and MVVP took their way in the Apps, together with RxJava and Dagger (2). I Also wrote some Kotlin.

In the past year (2018) I stopped working on Android and I spent the (little) spare time I have learning  Go and distributed systems stuff.

In 2019, I joined Red Hat to work in the kubernetes ecosystem. I am part of the Telco 5G network team, where we contribute to OpenShift with features that make it possible to run telco workoads on an OpenShift cluster.

### Opensource Contributions

I've been contributing to Firefox for Android intensively (2013-2014). Since summer 2018 I am contributing to Athens, the proxy for Go dependencies. In early 2020 I was made contributor of Athens.
