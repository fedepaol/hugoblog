###.. since my last blogpost. 
I've done a few things in the meanwhile, I wrote a game with LibGdx, I tinkered with various frameworks, but on top of all these things I've been taking care of my one (and a half) year old daughter. 

I do certainly have less time to devote to side projects, but I still like to learn new things and Android is exciting from that point of view.

While trying to catch up with all the new things that keep happening in the Android World, I hope I'll be able to post more often here.

PS: I used this post to reacquatain myself with octopress
