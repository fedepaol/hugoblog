### It's been a while
It's more than a year since my last blogpost which incidentally (or not) it happened right a month before the birth of my second child. In the past year I lost a lot of sleep, and now I am kind of getting back to normality (which means new side gigs :-)).

My interests moved from Android and mobile in general to Go and distributed systems, which is what I am probably going to write about in the next blogpost. Still, I am not sure if the green robot will catch my attention again but at the moment I am focusing on Go. 

That's the reason why I replaced the name of the blog to a more general one. 

#### A lot of interesting things happened:

**I attended conferences**: I went to QCon London and to Gophercon London.

After the experience of speaking at [Droidcon Italy 2014](http://fedepaol.github.io/blog/2014/02/20/rest-interaction-in-android/), **I re-started speaking in public:**

- DevFest Pisa 0.1, where I spoke about transitioning from C to Go [Golang for C developers](https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/fedepaol/go-for-c-devs-talk/goforcdevs.slide#1)
- Local GDG meetup, where I introduced Go and spoke about some concurrency patterns and [How to train your gophers](https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/fedepaol/howtotrainyourgophers/howtotrainyourgophers.slide#1)
- Golab.io, the Italian Go conference, where I spoke about [messaging with nats and go](https://speakerdeck.com/fedepaol/fast-messaging-with-nats-and-go) 

The last one was an awesome experience where I had the chance to speak in front of an international audience and meet so many interesting people.

**I started contributing to a Go OSS project**, namely [Athens](github.com/gomods/athens), the proxy for Go dependencies. It's nice to have a way to give something back to a thriving community.

#### What is coming next
Blogposts! I will probably write about the same stuff I spoke at golab, and keep blogging about Go and distributed systems.

Keep tuned !
