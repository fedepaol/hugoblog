Since my mobile device is a s60v3 one (Nokia E61), I found particulary difficult to develop any simple python script on the phone. The hardest thing to do was the write - test cycle.<br /><br />On linux you can't simply send the file to the phone with obex, since it will be stored in your incoming messages.<br /><br />From the excellent<a href="http://www.mobilenin.com/"> JÃ¼rgen Scheible</a>'s tutorial website I discovered the existance of the nice putools for making easier the development cycle <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/kapu/symbian/python.html">here</a><br /><br />It allows you to sync and reload the scripts on the phone directly from the pc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the instructions in the website are for a windows machine, but the whole tool is python based, so it is supposed do be (and it is) multiplatform.<br /><br />In the sync.config file you are asked to choose the right serial port over bluetooth file, which can be one of /dev/rfcommxx<br />ie: COM_PORT = '/dev/rfcomm2' instead of windows COMxx port<br /><br />The first problem I had then was related to a bug of my ubuntu distribution (8.04) described <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez-utils/+bug/227429">here</a>  which can be easly fixed installing the bluez-utils package from Debian Sid<br /><br />At this point, you can follow the instruction on the putools website by opening a serial port<br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;"> $ sdptool add --channel=2 SP</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms;"> $ rfcomm listen rfcomm2 2 </span><br /><br />and launching the script on the phone and finally launching from another shell the push command from the pcfiles folder.</div>

Other than the bug in the ubuntu package, any idea why I'd get the "port not open" exception? <BR/><BR/>I'm running intrepid which has the updated bluez-utils package, but wheneven I try push I get:<BR/>python push<BR/>file /home/rharding/.push/config<BR/>Connecting to serial port /dev/ttyS2<BR/>Traceback (most recent call last):<BR/>  File "push", line 75, in module<BR/>    main()<BR/>  File "push", line 55, in main<BR/>    app = App(0)<BR/>  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/_core.py", line 7912, in __init__<BR/>    self._BootstrapApp()<BR/>  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/_core.py", line 7487, in _BootstrapApp<BR/>    return _core_.PyApp__BootstrapApp(*args, **kwargs)<BR/>  File "push", line 38, in OnInit<BR/>    title='push' )<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/phoneshell.py", line 56, in __init__<BR/>    *args, **kwds)<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/phoneshell.py", line 243, in __init__<BR/>    *args, **kwds)<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/btinterpreter.py", line 105, in __init__<BR/>    self.bt.send( 'reset' )<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/../libs/phcomm.py", line 339, in send<BR/>    self.write( cmd )<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/../libs/phcomm.py", line 367, in write<BR/>    self.sock.send(msg)<BR/>  File "/home/rharding/Desktop/putools/pcfiles/../libs/phcomm.py", line 147, in send<BR/>    self.file.write( msg )<BR/>  File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/serial/serialposix.py", line 328, in write<BR/>    if self.fd is None: raise portNotOpenError<BR/>serial.serialutil.SerialException: Port not open</div>
