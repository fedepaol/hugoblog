This time, while PastTimer has not been released yet, I started an experiment with an old friend. We wanted not just to release another standalone app, but interact in some way with a backend.<br /><br />The result is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mydearsanta.info/">www.mydearsanta.info</a>&nbsp;, a web based Christmas list, which comes together with and Android app&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas</a>&nbsp;and an Iphone app (currently under the approval process) .<br /><br />The backend was written using the Django framework, and the apps interact with it using a json based rest api.</div>
