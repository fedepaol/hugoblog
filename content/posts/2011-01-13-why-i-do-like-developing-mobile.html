Well, I stopped and started thinking what's so cool about mobile development and mobile apps, and I would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />Before modern smartphones, most software was written to be consumed in desktop environment, where the user was sitting in front of his computer interacting with it.<br /><br />Smartphones make now easy doing something new: interacting with the environment the user belongs to. That is what I think is the most exciting thing of mobile dev. You have a bunch of information from all different sensors like gps, camera, accelerometers (and now nfc with android), and then you can mix them all and build whatever comes into your mind.<br />If this is not enough, you can even implement some service and put it somewhere in the internet, make your app a client of it and interact with other client applications.<br /><br />It now takes a reasonable amount of time to implement something that before was seen as science fiction or 007 gadgets, like video calls or augmented reality or location based service.<br /><br />I don't mean it couldn't be done before, but it's not an embedded stuff nieche with custom hardware and sensors anymore. With a 200$ smartphone and a 900$ laptop, you don't need anything else to implement a location based service with photosharing, istant messaging and all the stuff you want. And the new model of distribution makes easy to reach the users as well.<br /><br />This just from a mere technical point of view, you obviously need a good recepit to mix all the ingredients and come out with a successful product.<br /></div>
