<div class='post'>
A lot of things have changed since my last post, but some are still the same.<br />One of them is my curiosity and my passion for technologies.<br /><br />Why I am back here? Because I am trying to understand and develop some applications with Android framework, and I think it would be useful for me to have a place where collect the new things I learn. At the same time I hope these things will be useful for somebody out there.<br /><br />I am pretty new to Java, so please cut me some slack if you find some coding horror, but at the please time tell me what I could change to write a better and more correct code.<br /><br />    Federico<br /><br /><a id="publishButton" class="cssButton" href="javascript:void(0)" target="" onclick="if (this.className.indexOf(&quot;ubtn-disabled&quot;) == -1) {var e = document['stuffform'].publish;(e.length) ? e[0].click() : e.click(); if (window.event) window.event.cancelBubble = true; return false;}"><div class="cssButtonOuter"><div class="cssButtonMiddle"><div class="cssButtonInner"><br /></div></div></div></a></div>
