Pastimer is my 4th app. It's a simple (but nice) Android Kitchen Timer based on barcode scanning.<br /><br />I learned some things during my journey of android development, but this time I wanted to focus on user interface and ease of use.<br /><br />As always, it starts as a simple idea, the you start putting some code in it, it's "almost" working, and the difference between almost working and finished, is something like two months or more. I let it alone for more than two months.<br /><br />However, now it almost ready to be released, and it will very soon.<br /><br />The idea behind it is very simple.<br /><br />You point the barcode, the app looks in its internal database, and if it does know the time associated, starts a timer. If it does not recognize the barcode, it prompts the user asking to put the data.<br /><br />Sounds easy, doesn't it? You can give a look at a couple of screenshots here&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pastimerand/">Android Kitchen Timer</a></div>
