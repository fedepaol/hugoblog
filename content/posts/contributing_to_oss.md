Today I am going to write a non technical post, but about a topic I particularly care about.

It also feels like a good way to start 2020.


## Contributing to opensource is giving something to get something back

What you are giving away is your time and (eventually) your expertise.

## There are several reasons for contributing to an opensource project

- you need a feature in an oss project you rely on
- you want to learn
- you want to earn street credibility (more on this later)
- it feels good (it really does)

To me, it was a combination of those. My first experience with open source was related to my ramblings about Android and when I wanted to see what it felt like contributing in a bigger Android app. That's when I started [contributing to Firefox for Android](http://fedepaol.github.io/blog/2013/07/29/contributing-to-firefox-for-android/).

It turned out to be one of the best moves I have ever made for my career, not because I became a full time Android developer (although I got really close to that) but because it made me a better developer in many ways.

### Open Source code is different

And it's different in a better way. 
There is generally more emphasis on writing readable and maintainable code, because contributors may come and go.

This has two implications: 

- it will be harder to have your code merged because a higher quality of the code is required
- you will learn how to write readable and maintainable code

### Open Source is not (only) about writing code

**Sending the first version of a patch is only the initial part of the process**.

Contributing to a big project is the best way to get free coding lessons from the best developers out there, and it will also improve your communication skills. 

When approaching a new project, you will need to earn the trust of the maintainers, and your code will be checked thoroughly.

You submit the pull request, then the ballet start. 

You have to listen to suggestions, clarify your intentions, change your code. And iterate, until the merge happens.

Contributing a 3 liners patch can take weeks of discussion.


## How to approach an open source project

### If you need a feature

This is the easiest (and quite rewarding) way to find something to contribute.

You are adding value to a project you are already using, and what's more, you'll be using the feature you just developed.

With just one advice: **always remember to discuss the feature first** (eventually, in an issue). This will save you a lot of time in case the maintaners don't think the issue fits the scope of the project.

### If you want to contribute for learning (or looking better :-) )

#### First step: find the right project

I recommend a bit of investigation, before choosing the right project.

You can starting from the applications / project you use to narrow the scope, but bear in mind that some project are more welcoming to contributors than others.

What you should look for:

- contributing guidelines
- good first issue (or similar) labels
- a good number of opened issue to work on
- developers guidelines

You may want to clone the project and try to build it, to see how the dev experience look like.

And this is the tip of the iceberg.

Then, you should look at how active the maintainers are, if there are any stagnating open prs (you don't want to wait weeks to have your code in), and how often they are merged.

In general, a good probe for the project liveness is to try to discuss the issue first. This will also help to make sure nobody else is already working on the same issue.

Other indicators of a good project:

- Continuous Integration
- Releases / meaningful tags

## You don't need to be a super skilled developer

In all projects there are different problems of different levels.

Just start with something simple, to get familiar with the people, the development process and the codebase.

This is exactly the reason why we put "good first issue" labels.

**Remember that a new contributor is really appreciated, and the maintainers will do their best to keep you happy**.

Just step in, say hi and let things happen.

## What do you get back

Contributing to a project can drain a lot of energy. Now that I have kids, I find it exremely difficult to find the time to do some contributions.

On the other hand, there a lot of you'll get back. 

### You will learn a lot

I found Firefox for Android because I wanted to see a big Android project, I started contributing to Athens because I wanted somebody to review my Go code. 

By contributing to the right project, you'll see (and learn) how the best people in the industry work, and you'll get advices from them **for free**.

On the non technical side, you will learn how to communicate with a distributed team using the right tools, and (something not to forget) you will improve your English skills.

### Networking

You will (virtually) meet a lot of people, in many cases some of the best people in the industry.

As somebody who worked for a local company for almost 15 years, I can't state enough how this is important. It was my window on the outside world.

You'll eventually get new friends, and friends help each other. You'll have somebody outside your local bubble to ask for advices (and to drink a beer with during conferences).

### A good mark on your resume

Spending some of your free time writing code shows passion and willingness to learn, which are priceless values in our job.

Every time I had an interview, people asked me how contributing to Firefox looked like. 

If you pick the right project, you will make a good impression as a candidate.
In case you are a new graduate, it will make an even bigger difference: while the other freshmen will put their lab projects on their resume, you will put a well known project that everybody use.

Finally, by working on an oss project you demonstrate to be able to work in a remote environment, which can be taken as a plus in case you want to apply to remote positions.

### It feels goods

The key word here is "community".
Nowdays, a lot of the software we use come from there. People putting in their time to make it work. **It really feels good to be able to contribute something back**.

The idea of a collective contribution to something that makes the state of the technology go forward is really romantic, and despite I am not an OSS integralist, I really appreciate it.

## Next steps

- learn the github workflow
- pick a project
- find an issue and say hi
- be nice (and humble)
