<p>We find a lot of reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don&rsquo;t feel good enough</li>
<li>We think the project is too complex</li>
<li>We are afraid of rejections</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, everyone can find a project to add value to, starting from small things to more complex ones.</p>
<p><strong>Contributors are a rare commodity</strong>, and the maintainers will try to do their best to make you feel comfortable and stick on the project.</p>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>you need a feature in an oss project you use</li>
<li>you want to learn</li>
<li>it feels good (it really does)</li>
<li>you want to earn credibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, it was a combination of those. My first experience with open source was related to my ramblings about Android and when I wanted to see what it felt like contributing in a bigger Android app. That&rsquo;s when I started <a href="http://fedepaol.github.io/blog/2013/07/29/contributing-to-firefox-for-android/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributing to Firefox for Android</a>.</p>
<p>It turned out to be one of the best moves I have ever made for my career, not because I became a full time Android developer (although I got really close to that) but because it made me a better developer in many ways.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-code-is-different">

  </a>
</h3>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different in a better way.
There is generally more emphasis on writing readable and maintainable code, because of many reasons.</p>
<p>This has two implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will be harder to have your code merged because a higher quality of the code is required</li>
<li>you will learn how to write readable and maintainable code</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p><strong>Sending the first version of a patch is only the initial part of the process</strong>.</p>
<p>Contributing to a big project is the best way to get free coding lessons from the best developers out there, and it will also improve your communication skills.</p>
<p>When approaching a new project, you will need to earn the trust of the maintainers, and your code will be checked thoroughly.</p>
<p>You submit the pull request, then the ballet start.</p>
<p>You have to listen to suggestions, clarify your intentions, change your code. And iterate, until the merge happens.</p>
<p>Contributing a 3 liners patch can take weeks of discussion.</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>This is the easiest (and quite rewarding) way to find something to contribute.</p>
<p>You are adding value to a project you are already using, and what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll be using the feature you just developed.</p>
<p>With just one advice: <strong>always remember to discuss the feature first</strong> (eventually, in an issue). This will save you a lot of time in case the maintaners don&rsquo;t think the issue fits the scope of the project.</p>

</h4>
<p>I recommend a bit of investigation, before choosing the right project.</p>
<p>You can starting from the applications / project you use to narrow the scope, but bear in mind that some project are more welcoming to contributors than others.</p>
<p>What you should look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>contributing guidelines</li>
<li>good first issue (or similar) labels</li>
<li>a good number of opened issue to work on</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributing guidelines might be outdated, but they still show the good intentions of helping contributors.</p>
<p>You may want to clone the project and try to build it, to see how the dev experience look like.</p>
<p>And this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Then, you should look at how active the maintainers are, if there are any stagnating open prs (you don&rsquo;t want to wait weeks to have your code in), and how often they are merged.</p>
<p>In general, a good probe for the project liveness is to try to discuss the issue first. This will also help to make sure nobody else is already working on the same issue.</p>
<p>Other indicators of a good project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
<li>Releases / meaningful tags</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to contribute to something that is properly released and people are using, and the lack of releases is often a red flag.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-need-to-be-a-super-skilled-developer">
  You don&rsquo;t need to be a super skilled developer

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>I am repeating again, because starting is the hardest thing.</p>
<p>In all projects there are different problems of different levels.</p>
<p>Just start with something simple, to get familiar with the people, the development process and the codebase.</p>
<p>This is exactly the reason why we put &ldquo;good first issue&rdquo; labels.</p>
<p>Just step in, say hi and let things happen. People (even the &ldquo;rockstar&rdquo; ones) are happy to help when new contributors approach.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-you-get-back">
  What do you get back

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Contributing to a project can drain a lot of energy. Now that I have kids, I find it exremely difficult to find the time to do some contributions but still, I keep trying.</p>
<h3 id="you-will-learn-a-lot">
  You will learn a lot
  <a class="heading-link" href="#you-will-learn-a-lot">

  </a>
</h3>
<p>I found Firefox for Android because I wanted to see a big Android project, I started contributing to Athens because I wanted somebody to review my Go code.</p>
<p>By contributing to the right project, you&rsquo;ll see (and learn) how the best people in the industry work, and you&rsquo;ll get advices from them <strong>for free</strong>.</p>
<p>On the non technical side, you will learn how to communicate with a distributed team using the right tools, and (something not to forget) you will improve your English skills.</p>
<h3 id="networking">

</h3>
<p>You will (virtually) meet a lot of people, in many cases some of the best people in the industry.</p>
<p>As somebody who worked for a local company for almost 15 years, I can&rsquo;t state enough how this is important. It was my window on the outside world.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll eventually get new friends, and friends help each other. You&rsquo;ll have somebody outside your local bubble to ask for advices (and to drink a beer with during conferences).</p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>Spending some of your free time writing code shows passion and willingness to learn, which are priceless values in our job.</p>
<p>Every time I had an interview, people asked me how contributing to Firefox looked like.</p>
<p>If you pick the right project, you will make a good impression as a candidate.
In case you are a new graduate, it will make an even bigger difference compared to the other freshmen.</p>
<p>Finally, by working on an oss project you demonstrate to be able to work in a remote environment which could make it easier to land a remote position.</p>
<h3 id="it-feels-goods">

</h3>
<p>OpenSource is everywhere, and used in a lot of places. <strong>It really feels good to be able to contribute something back</strong>, to see a final result as a collective effort you took part to.</p>
<p>The idea of a collective contribution to something that makes the state of the technology go forward is really romantic, and despite I am not an OSS integralist, I really appreciate it.</p>

</h2>
<p>Contributing is hard, and may be daunting at first. But <strong>it&rsquo;s totally worth it</strong>. You&rsquo;ll learn, make your resume better and make new friends. I strongly recommend to do the first step, ask to fix an issue or to contribute in some way. And follow the events.</p>
