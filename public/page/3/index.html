        EDIT 17/10/2012:
Gridlayout support is now working natively with maven android deployer. I strongly suggest to use it instead of my method.
---------------------------

Gridlayout has been introduced since api level 14, and is being suggested layout as a more efficient alternative over nested linear layouts and relative layout.
It has also been recently added as part of the android support library, in order to have it available on older devices.

        I have been curious about intellij since droicon uk 2011, where I noticed that some of the speakers were using IntelliJ instead of eclipse.
A post from Richard Hyndman, who is a developer advocate from Google, was the final straw that pushed me to download IntelliJ and give it a try.
The first thing an eclipse user will notice in intellij is how slick and fast compares to the behemoth which is eclipse.

        Or how to keep your app connected and stop worrying.&nbsp;
Disclaimer:
This is not another place where you can find java code snippet to open a socket and read and write to some server.
If you need that, go back to your favorite search engine and look for another result. But be careful: while looking for "inspiration" I found a lot of examples where the connection was held inside the UI thread.

        Edit 2013-03-10: I've performed a substancial refactoring of postmanlib, and the details can be found in this new post
With the development of MyDearSanta app, I needed to fetch and put some data to a rest service developed using django python framework with a simple set of json based rest apis.
The development of the interaction between android and the rest web service was a bit messy because I was in hurry to release the app before Christmas (giving it's xmas related nature), but while developing it I thought it could have been a good start for my first android library.

         Pastimer, my barcode based kitchen timer is now on the market.
The basic idea is to scan the barcode on the box to set the time.

The url to download it from the market is
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.whiterabbit.pastimer
or this for the lite version
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.whiterabbit.pastimer.lite
The description of the product can be found here&nbsp;Android Kitchen Timer

        This time, while PastTimer has not been released yet, I started an experiment with an old friend. We wanted not just to release another standalone app, but interact in some way with a backend.
The result is&nbsp;www.mydearsanta.info&nbsp;, a web based Christmas list, which comes together with and Android app&nbsp;https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas&nbsp;and an Iphone app (currently under the approval process) .
The backend was written using the Django framework, and the apps interact with it using a json based rest api.

        Pastimer is my 4th app. It's a simple (but nice) Android Kitchen Timer based on barcode scanning.
I learned some things during my journey of android development, but this time I wanted to focus on user interface and ease of use.
As always, it starts as a simple idea, the you start putting some code in it, it's "almost" working, and the difference between almost working and finished, is something like two months or more.

        Apart from some rest, and reading some good books (like excellent Kent Beck's Test Driven development by example, and "growing object-oriented software guided by tests"), I have been working on a new app in the last month or so.
A week end locked at home because my gf was ill, was a good excuse to start a deep programming session. The app I am about to release (well, to be honest it still lacks all the nice ui parts, it just look like a bunch of grey buttons thrown on the screen) solves (or at least tries to simplify) a problem I have every time I need to cook pasta.

        This time I want to share something I learned about working in background on android.
One of the biggest advantages of android over ios (or, at least, some ios version ago) is that your app is not sandboxed and can continue to live in background.
To perform background (not visible) work, all you need to know is how to use android services.
A service is a piece of an application that is allowed to be active even if the application is not in foreground anymore.

        It's already been 18 days, and it's time to make some considerations.
For those who don't know what pegdroid is, it's a simple peg solitaire for android. I released it 18 days ago, it's free and it's basically ad-supported (but I don't get much from that).
I integrated google analytics in my app, so I can get some help from the statistics I get every day. In the meanwhile, the market dashboard got updated and I also can see which kind of device are the most popular.
