        I just released a new game. It's (yet another) version of the popular solitaire game. I thought its name was "Chinese checkers", but it looks like it's most common name is "Peg". Anyway, it didn't take (too) much to develop it, I really enjoyed learning something about the powerful andengine framework, but I am still proceeding at a slow pace since I can work on android only after my daytime job.

        Another thing I always wanted to do was game programming. Moving objects and interacting with the game, as well as having fun with them, gives great satisfaction.
I think the fun part is that you have immediate feedback of what is happening, it's just not like filling an edit text and pressing a button (or server side programming).
Given that I am spending much of my spare time in (trying to) learning mobile development, I tried to merge the two things, and I came across to andengine framework.

        Well, I stopped and started thinking what's so cool about mobile development and mobile apps, and I would like to share my thoughts.
Before modern smartphones, most software was written to be consumed in desktop environment, where the user was sitting in front of his computer interacting with it.
Smartphones make now easy doing something new: interacting with the environment the user belongs to. That is what I think is the most exciting thing of mobile dev.

        I released DroidAlone on the market in the early summer. You can find a description at the following url&nbsp;DroidAlone - Missed call for Android
It is a paid app, and it costs something like 0.99 euros. It has been downloaded something like 150 times since then.
I also had some issues in choosing its name: at first it was homealone, but I was afraid to Mr Culkin knokin' to my door for royalties, then it was phonealone but there was already one, and then it moved to DroidAlone.

        This won't be a strictly technical post, but something related to some of my impressions during android development.
I read a lot of stuff about android, and how at first it looks so easy to deploy an android application.
What I realized in the last year is that releasing something that "almost" work is not enough. Your app will be buried under bad reviews and, since android does not make any filter on app quality, it will just be one of the many apps out there or, even worse, it will be under below of the apps out there.

        It may sound weird, but I discovered java development while trying to learn android development itself.
Along with Java, eclipse and all this nice stuff, I discovered junit too.
One of the problems I encountered while developing my second app, droidalone, was to test intent services.
Intent services are a powerful way to handle background task. They basically are services that run in their own thread and die (like non sticky services) after they finished their job.

        EDIT 11/11/2012: as described in this new blog post, I modified the script to generate a content provider as well
This is my first post about something related to android.
Just to break the ice, I would like to introduce a simple helper script I developed this summer.
Android ships with a very nice local storage, which is sqllite. It's said almost everywhere that, in order to make your life easier, you should develop an helper class.

        Well, maintaining a blog looks harder than I thought, but this is another attempt to keep it alive.
I'll say something more about me, just to break the ice: I live in Italy, I am a software engineer, and my current employer is a company whose main products are related to finance.
I'm currently working to maintain and to evolve the brokerage platform of one major italian bank. After developing it's main core components, I had the honor (?

        A lot of things have changed since my last post, but some are still the same.
One of them is my curiosity and my passion for technologies.
Why I am back here? Because I am trying to understand and develop some applications with Android framework, and I think it would be useful for me to have a place where collect the new things I learn. At the same time I hope these things will be useful for somebody out there.

        Since my mobile device is a s60v3 one (Nokia E61), I found particulary difficult to develop any simple python script on the phone. The hardest thing to do was the write - test cycle.
On linux you can't simply send the file to the phone with obex, since it will be stored in your incoming messages.
From the excellentJürgen Scheible's tutorial website I discovered the existance of the nice putools for making easier the development cycle here
