        Why robolectric I&rsquo;ve been a fan of robolectric since the old days, since when Android Studio was not an option and few developers embraced IntelliJ. I left it a bit behind after the introduction of Android Studio, since its support was far from optimal.
Things have changed, and after listening Corey Latislaw advocating its usage during this fragmented podcast episode I wanted to give it a spin. Even if there is a bit of debate over its usage, mainly because tests are performed against mocked objects instead of the real framework code, it is the fastest lane to your tdd cycle because tests are run on the local jvm instead of being packed in an apk, deployed on a device and run over there.

        ###.. since my last blogpost. I&rsquo;ve done a few things in the meanwhile, I wrote a game with LibGdx, I tinkered with various frameworks, but on top of all these things I&rsquo;ve been taking care of my one (and a half) year old daughter.
I do certainly have less time to devote to side projects, but I still like to learn new things and Android is exciting from that point of view.

        While working on my last side gig, a patch to Firefox for Android to allow the urlbar to be dragged in order to show content hidden behind the main view, I had to deal with ViewDragHelper and understand how it works.
The final result (please note that the patch is still under review) is something like this:
  It caused me more than one headache, and for this reason I am writing this post hoping it might be helpful to anybody wanting to tinker with it.

        Preloading data in Sqlite is a common problem during android development.
The most common solutions are:
hardcode the insert statements and execute them (possibly inside a transaction) the first time the db is openedplace the data inside a csv file, load it the first time the db gets opened, parse the rows and populate the dbprepare a pre-built sqlite file, ship it along with your app and load it the first time the db is opened

        In last December ('13) I was asked to submit a talk proposal for the first Italian Droidcon, which I did. It got accepted, so in Febraury I gave my first public speech speaking of "(O)Authenticated Rest Interaction in Android" in front of real people. This post is meant to be a follow up with the information that can't be found in the slides
 I hoped to sum all the talk up in a post, but it got too long so I am going to split it in several pieces.

        In the past two / three years I have been (mostly) developing Android code, even before it was cool(tm), as a way to do something different from what I do during my day time job.
I wrote some apps, a couple of libraries, and some 80% finished projects I really hope I will finish some day.
Recently I thought that joining some big android related open source project could have been interesting, and I went for them.

        Android and RestMy PostManLib android library had a quite troubled genesis. Some infos can be found in this old post&nbsp;, but bear in mind that I only kept the skeleton of what I wrote at that time (which, by the way, was inspired by&nbsp;this&nbsp;talk).
The api was (to be kind) a bit clunky, and I recently chose to rewrite / finish it. Apart from its clunkyness, one thing was missing:

        Whenever I speak with another android developer, the occasional chat goes to "what did you develop?" question.
Last time it happened at droidcon uk, and for the first time I felt something wasn't completely right when I showed my DroidAlone app.
DroidAlone is a useful app (so they say) that comes into play whenever you forget your phone at home. With a simple sms protected by a password choosen by the user, it can be activated.

        During the refactoring of my two years old app DroidAlone, I decided to try to access to the storage through a ContentProvider.
Even if the official documentation warns that there is no need to use content providers if your app does not want to export it's data against other apps, there are a bunch of advantages in using a content provider in your app.
The main and more obvious advantage is that you can use a Loader with your data.

        Here I am, back again from my third DroidconUk experience.

I can still remember explaining to my non tech friends what Android was the evening of the 1st droidcon, and since then it became a sort of ritual, a couple of days when I can take some rest from my day time job and take part to the community of some of the best android developers coming from all over the Europe.
