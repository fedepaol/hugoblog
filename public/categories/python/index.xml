      <description>During the refactoring of my two years old app DroidAlone, I decided to try to access to the storage through a ContentProvider.
Even if the official documentation warns that there is no need to use content providers if your app does not want to export it&#39;s data against other apps, there are a bunch of advantages in using a content provider in your app.
The main and more obvious advantage is that you can use a Loader with your data.</description>

      <description>EDIT 11/11/2012: as described in this new blog post, I modified the script to generate a content provider as well
This is my first post about something related to android.
Just to break the ice, I would like to introduce a simple helper script I developed this summer.
Android ships with a very nice local storage, which is sqllite. It&#39;s said almost everywhere that, in order to make your life easier, you should develop an helper class.</description>
