      <description>This time I want to share something I learned about working in background on android.
One of the biggest advantages of android over ios (or, at least, some ios version ago) is that your app is not sandboxed and can continue to live in background.
To perform background (not visible) work, all you need to know is how to use android services.
A service is a piece of an application that is allowed to be active even if the application is not in foreground anymore.</description>
