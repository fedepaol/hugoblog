      <description>Edit 2013-03-10: I&#39;ve performed a substancial refactoring of postmanlib, and the details can be found in this new post
With the development of MyDearSanta app, I needed to fetch and put some data to a rest service developed using django python framework with a simple set of json based rest apis.
The development of the interaction between android and the rest web service was a bit messy because I was in hurry to release the app before Christmas (giving it&#39;s xmas related nature), but while developing it I thought it could have been a good start for my first android library.</description>
