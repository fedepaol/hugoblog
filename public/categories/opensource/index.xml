      <description>In the past two / three years I have been (mostly) developing Android code, even before it was cool(tm), as a way to do something different from what I do during my day time job.
I wrote some apps, a couple of libraries, and some 80% finished projects I really hope I will finish some day.
Recently I thought that joining some big android related open source project could have been interesting, and I went for them.</description>
