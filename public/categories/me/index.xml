      <description>A lot of things have changed since my last post, but some are still the same.
One of them is my curiosity and my passion for technologies.
Why I am back here? Because I am trying to understand and develop some applications with Android framework, and I think it would be useful for me to have a place where collect the new things I learn. At the same time I hope these things will be useful for somebody out there.</description>
