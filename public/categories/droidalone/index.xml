      <description>Whenever I speak with another android developer, the occasional chat goes to &#34;what did you develop?&#34; question.
Last time it happened at droidcon uk, and for the first time I felt something wasn&#39;t completely right when I showed my DroidAlone app.
DroidAlone is a useful app (so they say) that comes into play whenever you forget your phone at home. With a simple sms protected by a password choosen by the user, it can be activated.</description>

      <description>I released DroidAlone on the market in the early summer. You can find a description at the following url&amp;nbsp;DroidAlone - Missed call for Android
It is a paid app, and it costs something like 0.99 euros. It has been downloaded something like 150 times since then.
I also had some issues in choosing its name: at first it was homealone, but I was afraid to Mr Culkin knokin&#39; to my door for royalties, then it was phonealone but there was already one, and then it moved to DroidAlone.</description>
