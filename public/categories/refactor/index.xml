      <description>Whenever I speak with another android developer, the occasional chat goes to &#34;what did you develop?&#34; question.
Last time it happened at droidcon uk, and for the first time I felt something wasn&#39;t completely right when I showed my DroidAlone app.
DroidAlone is a useful app (so they say) that comes into play whenever you forget your phone at home. With a simple sms protected by a password choosen by the user, it can be activated.</description>
