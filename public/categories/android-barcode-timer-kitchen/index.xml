      <description>Apart from some rest, and reading some good books (like excellent Kent Beck&#39;s Test Driven development by example, and &#34;growing object-oriented software guided by tests&#34;), I have been working on a new app in the last month or so.
A week end locked at home because my gf was ill, was a good excuse to start a deep programming session. The app I am about to release (well, to be honest it still lacks all the nice ui parts, it just look like a bunch of grey buttons thrown on the screen) solves (or at least tries to simplify) a problem I have every time I need to cook pasta.</description>
