      <description>EDIT 17/10/2012:
Gridlayout support is now working natively with maven android deployer. I strongly suggest to use it instead of my method.
---------------------------

Gridlayout has been introduced since api level 14, and is being suggested layout as a more efficient alternative over nested linear layouts and relative layout.
It has also been recently added as part of the android support library, in order to have it available on older devices.</description>
