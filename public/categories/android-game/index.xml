      <description>It&#39;s already been 18 days, and it&#39;s time to make some considerations.
For those who don&#39;t know what pegdroid is, it&#39;s a simple peg solitaire for android. I released it 18 days ago, it&#39;s free and it&#39;s basically ad-supported (but I don&#39;t get much from that).
I integrated google analytics in my app, so I can get some help from the statistics I get every day. In the meanwhile, the market dashboard got updated and I also can see which kind of device are the most popular.</description>
