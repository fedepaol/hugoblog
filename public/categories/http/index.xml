      <description>In last December (&#39;13) I was asked to submit a talk proposal for the first Italian Droidcon, which I did. It got accepted, so in Febraury I gave my first public speech speaking of &#34;(O)Authenticated Rest Interaction in Android&#34; in front of real people. This post is meant to be a follow up with the information that can&#39;t be found in the slides
 I hoped to sum all the talk up in a post, but it got too long so I am going to split it in several pieces.</description>
