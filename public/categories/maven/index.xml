      <description>EDIT 17/10/2012:
Gridlayout support is now working natively with maven android deployer. I strongly suggest to use it instead of my method.
---------------------------

Gridlayout has been introduced since api level 14, and is being suggested layout as a more efficient alternative over nested linear layouts and relative layout.
It has also been recently added as part of the android support library, in order to have it available on older devices.</description>

      <description>I have been curious about intellij since droicon uk 2011, where I noticed that some of the speakers were using IntelliJ instead of eclipse.
A post from Richard Hyndman, who is a developer advocate from Google, was the final straw that pushed me to download IntelliJ and give it a try.
The first thing an eclipse user will notice in intellij is how slick and fast compares to the behemoth which is eclipse.</description>
