      <description>In last December (&#39;13) I was asked to submit a talk proposal for the first Italian Droidcon, which I did. It got accepted, so in Febraury I gave my first public speech speaking of &#34;(O)Authenticated Rest Interaction in Android&#34; in front of real people. This post is meant to be a follow up with the information that can&#39;t be found in the slides
 I hoped to sum all the talk up in a post, but it got too long so I am going to split it in several pieces.</description>

      <description>Edit 2013-03-10: I&#39;ve performed a substancial refactoring of postmanlib, and the details can be found in this new post
With the development of MyDearSanta app, I needed to fetch and put some data to a rest service developed using django python framework with a simple set of json based rest apis.
The development of the interaction between android and the rest web service was a bit messy because I was in hurry to release the app before Christmas (giving it&#39;s xmas related nature), but while developing it I thought it could have been a good start for my first android library.</description>
